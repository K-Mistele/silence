# Silence
Silence is a proof-of-concept C2 channel and reverse shell that leverages steganography 
and the ICMP protocol to send control data at the netework layer, bypassing traditional
transport-layer and application-layer firewalls. 

**While developing this project, do NOT let this touch the disk of a computer running any
sort of antivirus**
